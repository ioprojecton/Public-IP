# Public-IP
Public ip checker

Simple bash script to check and send an email notification if public ip address was renewed by ISP. I`m using sawks to send email. Google acount should be configured with 2-step verification + app password must be retreived from google acount. Can be automated with anacron or similar schedulers.
